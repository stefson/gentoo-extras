Bug 1434526 - Make MOZ_SIGNAL_TRAMPOLINE Android-only. r=gsvelto

Bug 1463035 exists to remove it entirely, because as mentioned in bug
1238661 comment 4, we don't actually need this workaround anymore. But
that bug has been blocked for a while because the Android emulator
images we use for testing, for some reason, use a kernel older than any
real device using the same version of Android would use.

Let's however fix the problems it causes with GCC on non-Android ARM
Linux by making it Android-only, rather than removing it entirely.

 // Some (old) Linux kernels on ARM have a bug where a signal handler
 // can be called without clearing the IT bits in CPSR first. The result
 // is that the first few instructions of the handler could be skipped,
 // ultimately resulting in crashes. To workaround this bug, the handler
 // on ARM is a trampoline that starts with enough NOP instructions, so
 // that even if the IT bits are not cleared, only the NOP instructions
 // will be skipped over.
