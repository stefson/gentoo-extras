Please use appropriate numbering scheme when adding patches.
All patches must contain a bug url for tracking purposes, unless 
they are build modifications specific to Gentoo. Example would be
disable sdk install, path modifications. User patches need to be sent 
upstream to ensure we can drop them as quick as possible.
